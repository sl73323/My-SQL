## identify the second highest salary from the table

## Method 1:
select distinct(salary) from employees  #identify distinct salary then sort
order by salary desc
limit 1 offset 1  ### selected top 1 and top 2 salaries but remove the top 1 use offset

## Method 2: If I want to select thrid highest salary, which means only 2 salaries is higher than my desired result. 
### Thus, compare two tables when only contains the exactly number of salary higher than my desired result. 

select max(salary) from employee e1
where N-1=(
select count(distinct (salary))from employee e2 
where e2.salary>e1.salary # identify the salarires greater than e1.salary.
